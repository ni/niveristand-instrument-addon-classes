# Instrument Addon Classes

The **Instrument Addon Classes** are used in the [Instrument Addon Custom Device](https://github.com/ni/niveristand-instrument-addon-custom-device) to handle the various instrument protocols and protection schemes over these protocols.

If installing the **Instrument Addon Custom Device** from a [released package](https://github.com/ni/niveristand-instrument-addon-custom-device/releases/latest), you do not need to separately clone or install this component. Only making modifications to the custom device's protocol or protections require using this repository as source.
